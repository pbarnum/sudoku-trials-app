## Sudoku Trials Privacy Policy

Thank you for your interest in Sudoku Trials!

This application was created for the love of programming, and for the new experience of publishing a mobile app.

#### Ads are enabled for this application!

Sudoku Trials uses [Google's AdMob](https://admob.google.com/home/resources/what-is-admob/) to display ads. I have included ads (banner at the bottom to be less intrusive) for passive income and incentive to continue to build mobile apps. 

Outside of ads, I can firmly say that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and game states) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
